This repository represents our final project at Holberton School, where we intend to apply the comprehensive range of skills acquired throughout our course. From our proficiency in both soft skills and programming, encompassing both backend and frontend development, we have created a web platform. Our platform caters to individuals seeking to practice and enhance their language skills, offering a space for language practice and improvement rather than formal language learning.
#### How it works?
This website is tailored to serve as a chat platform connecting individuals worldwide who share an interest in practicing the same language. Upon registration, a new account will be created in our database, granting you access to the main page. Here, you have the flexibility to engage in various activities, such as chatting with random users who share your linguistic interests, or reaching out to friends you've connected with.
#### Functionalities of this command interpreter:
* Create new account.
* Chat with friend.
